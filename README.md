### NOTE
This is a fork i made to allow external manipulation of the TinyFileManager such as localization, directory resolving etc.

You can do this by writing you own implementations of the given interfaces and overwriting the default object in the clsConfig.

### TinyFileManager.NET

####Demo and documentation resides here: http://www.andyarndt.net/TinyFileManager.aspx

This project is originally a direct port of the awesome project [FileManager4TinyMCE](https://github.com/2b3ez/FileManager4TinyMCE) from it's original php language to C#.

TinyFileManager.NET is a free, C# file manager plugin for TinyMCE v4.  It is best described as a collection of components and original code mashed together to solve a problem (for free).

This project is released under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  Feel free to edit/re-distribute in any way that is helpful to you.

####NOTE: This plugin is developed only for version 4+ of TinyMCE.  Plugins for TinyMCE versions 3.xx and older are written in a different format.
